The sky was a strange shade of violet today, like the universe was holding its breath. I walked through the old park, where the trees still whisper secrets if you listen closely. A rusty swing creaked in the wind, and I swear I saw a shadow move behind it—too quick to be human. Maybe it’s just my imagination, but this town feels... off lately. Lights flicker at night, and the radio keeps picking up static that sounds like words. I’m not sure if I’m curious or scared. Probably both.

Tomorrow, I’ll check the old library for those books on local legends. There’s got to be something about this place in there.
